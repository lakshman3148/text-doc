1. create vpc  (my-vpc)
2. create 2 subnets (public and private subnets)
3. create internet gateway and attach to our vpc
4. crate routetable  (do subnet association and edit routes) 
5. create ec2 instance with our vpc and public subnet (it will connect to server)
6. create ec2 instance with our vpc and private subnet (it doesn't connect to the server)
7. create natgateway and attcahe to private routetable



CIDR (Classless inter domain routing) 
range i.e., range of IP addresses we required. We can give CIDR Range as 0.0.0.0.0/n
Here n = netmask ranges between 16 to 32.
0 = 1 octet, each octet has 8 bits and can hold 0 to 255 IP4
Here I gave CIDR range 10.0.0.0/24 

N = 32 -24 = 8
2^8 = 256 IP4 i.e., 0 to 255 IP4

Here AWS Reserves first 4 and last IP4

10.0.0.0 – Network address
10.0.0.1 – Reserved by AWS for the VPC router
10.0.0.2 – Reserved by AWS, the IP address of DNS
10.0.0.3 – Reserved by AWS for future use
10.0.0.255 – Network broadcast address. As broadcast not supported in a VPC therefore the address is reserved.
